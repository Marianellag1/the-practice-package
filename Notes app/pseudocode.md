When user enters page, previous data (notes), will appear on screen. (those not deleted).
- local storage
When user wants to add a note, in input field, user can enter note, click on btn and note will be displayed.
->will be nice to have date of when the note was created on note entered.
if user doesn't want to keep note, user can delete that specific note, or delete all notes.
-> delete all

Addition to the practice, toggling light and dark page display for user experience.
